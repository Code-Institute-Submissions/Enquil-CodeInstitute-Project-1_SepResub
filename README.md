## Pages and Features

### Welcome/About

This page serves 2 purposes. 
It is the main welcome page as well as an introduction to the owner and artists working here.
It contains a short bio, as well as links to other work from the artists.

### Gallery

Contains image galleries with tattoo art done at the studio, description is supposed to be changed from 'Hello world!', to instead contain name of artist and customer and possible date.

### Booking

This page lets you book a consultation with the studio via JavaScript form and attach images or other files that might be relevant, it also contains info about booking and fees but the client has not decided on one yet.

### Aftercare

Instructions on how to nurse a tattoo, contains a downloadable .pdf that provides full coverage from day 1 to fully healed. <br>
Also contains a "first 2 weeks"-guide with some general tips that are extra crucial during initial stages of healing.

### Missing content

Link to webshop does not work, since it doesent exist yet.
Right side images and some Javascript in the whitespace is missing, will be incorporated simultaneously, credits will also be added then.


## User Experience and Design
---

* Overarching design and Colourscheme
  
  * Tried out a few designs/color schemes and because of what the subject/client is, this felt most appropriate, left side is text, right is related art/images.
As stated, black and gray is sort of the "spiritual" theme of the actual studio, i was a bit worried about contrasts when incorporating gray and opacity, im still not sure but feedback has been positive about it thus far.
Social media links and the "submit" button on the form are the only coloured "infrastructure" part of the side, images will have some colour in them as well.
I chose a linear-gradient style for the backgrounds as to get the sense of actually going down.

* Colours

  * Background is custom texture to mimic rock, didnt come out as planned, will switch to bricks.
  * Text is Whitesmoke RGB 245, 245, 245.
  * Nav, page-welcome and footer is linear-gradient top -> right RGBA 82, 82, 82, 0.8, RGBA 52, 52, 52, 0.9, RGBA 22, 22, 22.
  * Submit button on form is linear gradient top-left -> bottom right RGB 202, 202, 222, RGB 162, 162, 192, RGB 132, 132, 162, RGB 102, 102, 132.
