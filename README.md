## Pages and Features

### Welcome/About

This page serves 2 purposes. 
It is the main welcome page as well as an introduction to the owner and artists working here.
It contains a short bio, as well as links to other work from the artists.

### Gallery

Contains image galleries with tattoo art done at the studio, description is supposed to be changed from 'Hello world!', to instead contain name of artist and customer and possible date.

### Booking

This page lets you book a consultation with the studio via JavaScript form and attach images or other files that might be relevant, it also contains info about booking and fees but the client has not decided on one yet.

### Aftercare

Instructions on how to nurse a tattoo, contains a downloadable .pdf that provides full coverage from day 1 to fully healed. <br>
Also contains a "first 2 weeks"-guide with some general tips that are extra crucial during initial stages of healing.

### Navigation bar

Same on every page, trimmed it down to 4 buttons in the end, About, Gallery, Booking and Aftercare.

### Footer

Fixed position, contains phone-nr and email to the left, social media in the middle and a copyright on the right.

### Missing content

Link to webshop does not work, since it doesent exist yet.
Right side images and some Javascript in the whitespace is missing, will be incorporated simultaneously, credits will also be added then.


## User Experience and Design
---

* Overarching design and Colourscheme
  * Tried out a few designs/color schemes and because of what the subject/client is, this felt most appropriate, left side is text, right is related art/images, want to end it up having a "booky" feel to it.
  * Social Media was colored to make it stand out a bit against the rest of the page, no idea if it actually will make people click it more but i figured it wont hurt.

* Colours
  * Black/gray backgrounds with white text, had some worries about visibility when using opacity and a textured background, but feedback has been good thus far.
  * Background is custom texture to mimic rock, didnt come out as planned, will switch to something brick-like maybe and a bit darker for contrast.
  * Text is whitesmoke, rgb(245, 245, 245).
  * Nav, page-welcome and footer is linear-gradient top -> right rgba(82, 82, 82, 0.8), rgba(52, 52, 52, 0.9), rgba(22, 22, 22).
  * Submit button on form is linear gradient top-left -> bottom right RGB(202, 202, 222), rgb(162, 162, 192), rgb(132, 132, 162), rgb(102, 102, 132).

* JavaScript related design
  * None implemented yet, most JS will be infrastructure only but some animation will probably be implemented at a later date.


## Acessability
---

* Aria labels
  * Will most likely be added to nav-menu, form, pdf anchor and webshop anchor, more implementation might be coming.
