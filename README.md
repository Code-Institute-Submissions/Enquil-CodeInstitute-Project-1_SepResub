### Welcome/About

This page serves 2 purposes. 
It is the main welcome page as well as an introduction to the owner and artists working here.
It contains a short bio, as well as links to other work from the artists.

### Gallery

Contains image galleries with tattoo art done at the studio, description is supposed to be changed from 'Hello world!', to instead contain name of artist and customer and possible date.

### Booking

This page lets you book a consultation with the studio via JavaScript form and attach images or other files that might be relevant, it also contains info about booking and fees but the client has not decided on one yet.

### Aftercare

Instructions on how to nurse a tattoo, contains a downloadable .pdf that provides full coverage from day 1 to fully healed. <br>
Also contains a "first 2 weeks"-guide with some general tips that are extra crucial during initial stages of healing.

### Missing content

Link to webshop does not work since construction is underway, right side and "white space" is reserved for JavaScript. 


## User Experience and Design
---

* Overarching design and Colourscheme
* * Tried out a few designs/color schemes and because of what the client is, this felt most appropriate, left side is text, right is related art/images.
As stated above, black and gray is sort of the "spiritual" theme of the actual studio, i was a bit worried about contrasts when incorporating gray and opacity, im still not sure but feedback has been positive about it thus far.
Social media links and the "submit" button on the form are the only coloured "infrastructure" part of the side, images will have some colour in them as well.
