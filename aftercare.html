                    There are a couple general rules of thumb, to keep in mind when nursing your tattoo.
                    This is especially true for the first week or so when most problems arise.
                    However, they are rare in general, good hygiene truly is a modern miracle.
                    Follow some basic instructions, keep a good routine and it should come out nicely.
                    I have also put together a pdf that goes over everything you need to know,
                    It also covers medical protective film, or "snakeskin".

                <h2>
                    Initial Care and General Guidelines
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The first 2 weeks are the most crucial in terms of inflammation prevention and healing outcome in the long run.
                    It's not rocket science , but in order to heal properly, you need to mind a few things.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stay aways from heavier workouts for 48 hours, it should be fine after that BUT be cautious
                        while a tiny tear doesent destroy the tattoo, it doesent exactly help healing either, you feel me?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Wash your hands, honestly it's general life advice but you should especially do it when caring for a tattoo. <br>
                        One more thing, dont let anyone else's dirty paws near your ink, for obvious reasons.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The plastic wrap you get at the studio can stay on 3-4 hours after being applied. <br>
                        After that, you should gently wash it with som mild soap.<br>
                        See <a href="assets/media/care.pdf" aria-label="download care-pdf">PDF</a> for instructions on medical protective wrap, or "snakeskin" 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DONT GO SWIMMING <br> 
                        and dont shower for too long, since it softens the skin.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        DONT COOK IT <br> 
                        Ideally, you dont expose it to the sun at all for the first 2 weeks.
                        But most people dont sleep in coffins, so be responsible, okay?
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>

                    Or "snakeskin", as the cool kids call it. <br>
                    One thing to know, is that each manufacturer
                    has their own instructions, so read and follow them. <br>
                    In any case, here are some general tips.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Changing intervals vary, depending on manufacturer and material. <br>
                            Just like with IKEA furniture, read and follow the instructions, guessing where the screws go never ends well for you... ugh
                        </li> 
                        <li>
                            If fluid keeps pooling underneath the film, you call Almen-Ink on 0700000000
                            or your health care provider. <br>
                            It's most likely nothing serious but you dont wanna go "Aah it's probably nothing", and then find out it was something the hard way.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Dont peel it, scratch it or touch it unnecessarily. <br> 
                            In fact, unless you are going to change it or suspect something is wrong, dont even look at it. <br>
                            Eyes up here buddy.
                        </li>
